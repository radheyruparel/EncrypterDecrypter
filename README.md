Encrypter or Decrypter Methods

Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. 


Encrypter
This program will be to encrypt (“mix” or “shuffle”) the lines of a given text file, but do it in such a way that it can be un-done later with a separate program (which you will also write). My mixing it will also create a key/index file for we can rerange the data in a orginal format.

Decrypter
The program will read in these two files as input,the key/index and encrypted text file. Then using the information stored within these files, it will put the contents back in the original order. 

This code shows my advance abilites of file reading and writing, random, and use of lists
